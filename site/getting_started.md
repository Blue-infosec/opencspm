# Getting Started

### How is OpenCSPM deployed?

There are two primary methods of deployment:

1. Local-mode: Running the platform on a local system with [docker](https://docker.com) and [docker-compose](https://docker/com/compose) to support temporary testing, one-off assessments, and custom policy check development.
2. Dedicated-mode: Running the platform inside the cloud account using dedicated resources managed by infrastructure-as-code ([terraform](https://terraform.io)).
